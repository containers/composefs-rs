# Splitstream

Splitstream is a trivial way of storing file formats (like tar) with the "data
blocks" stored in the composefs object store with the goal that it's possible
to bit-for-bit recreate the entire file.  It's something like the idea behind
[tar-split](https://github.com/vbatts/tar-split), with some important
differences:

 - it's a binary format

 - it's based on storing external objects content-addressed in the composefs
   object store via their fs-verity digest

 - although it's designed with `tar` files in mind, it's not specific to `tar`,
   or even to the idea of an archive file: any file format can be stored as a
   splitstream, and it might make sense to do so for any file format that
   contains large chunks of embedded data

 - in addition to the ability to split out chunks of file content (like files
   in a `.tar`) to separate files, it is also possible to refer to external
   file content, or even other splitstreams, without directly embedding that
   content in the referrer, which can be useful for cross-document references
   (such as between OCI manifests, configs, and layers)

 - the splitstream file itself is stored in the same content-addressed object
   store by its own fs-verity hash

Splitstream compresses inline file content before it is stored to disk using
zstd.  The main reason for this is that, after removing the actual file data,
the remaining `tar` metadata contains a very large amount of padding and empty
space and compresses extremely well.

Splitstream is conceptually independent from composefs: you could use the
format with any content-addressed storage system.

## File format

What follows is a non-normative documentation of the file format.  The actual
definition of the format is "what composefs-rs reads and writes", but this
document may be useful to try to understand that format.  If you'd like to
implement the format, please get in touch.

The format is implemented in
[crates/composefs/src/splitstream.rs](crates/composefs/src/splitstream.rs) and
the structs from that file are copy-pasted here.  Please try to keep things
roughly in sync when making changes to either side.

All integers are little-endian.  In the following `struct` definitions, `U`
means 'unsigned little endian' (as per the `zerocopy::little_endian` crate) so
`U64` is an unsigned 64bit little-endian integer.

### File ranges ("sections")

The file format consists of a fixed-sized header at the start of the file plus
a number of sections located at arbitrary locations inside of the file.  All of
these sections are referred to by a 64-bit `[start..end)` range expressed in
terms of overall byte offsets within the complete file.

```rust
struct FileRange {
    start: U64,
    end: U64,
}
```

### Header

The file starts with a simple fixed-size header.

```rust
const SPLITSTREAM_MAGIC: [u8; 11] = *b"SplitStream";

struct SplitstreamHeader {
    pub magic: [u8; 11],  // Contains SPLITSTREAM_MAGIC
    pub version: u8,      // must always be 0
    pub _flags: U16,      // is currently always 0 (but ignored)
    pub algorithm: u8,    // kernel fs-verity algorithm identifier (1 = sha256, 2 = sha512)
    pub lg_blocksize: u8, // log2 of the fs-verity block size (12 = 4k, 16 = 64k)
    pub info: FileRange,  // can be used to expand/move the info section in the future
}
```

In addition to magic values and identifiers for the fs-verity algorithm in use,
the header is used to find the location and size of the info section.  Future
expansions to the file format are imagined to occur by expanding the size of
the info section: if the section is larger than expected, the additional bytes
will be ignored by the implementation.

### Info section

```rust
struct SplitstreamInfo {
    pub stream_refs: FileRange, // location of the stream references array
    pub object_refs: FileRange, // location of the object references array
    pub stream: FileRange,      // location of the zstd-compressed stream within the file
    pub named_refs: FileRange,  // location of the compressed named references
    pub content_type: U64,      // user can put whatever magic identifier they want there
    pub stream_size: U64,       // total uncompressed size of inline chunks and external chunks
}
```

The `content_type` is just an arbitrary identifier that can be used by users of
the file format to prevent casual user error when opening a file by its hash
value (to prevent showing `.tar` data as if it were json, for example).

The `stream_size` is the total size of the original file.

### Stream and object refs sections

All referred streams and objects in the file are stored as two separate flat
uncompressed arrays of binary fs-verity hash values.  Each of these arrays is
referred to from the info section (via `stream_refs` and `object_refs`).

The number of items in the array is determined by the size of the section
divided by the size of the fs-verity hash value (determined by the algorithm
identifier in the header).

The values are not in any particular order, but implementations should produce
a deterministic output.  For example, the objects reference array produced by
the current implementation has the external objects sorted by first-appearance
within the stream.

The main motivation for storing the references uncompressed, in binary, and in
a flat array is to make determining the references contained within a
splitstream as simple as possible to improve the efficiency of garbage
collection on large repositories.

### The stream

The main content of the splitstream is stored in the `stream` section
referenced from the info section.  The entire section is zstd compressed.

Within the compressed stream, the splitstream is formed from a number of
"chunks".  Each chunk starts with a single 64-bit little endian value.  If that
number is negative, it refers to an "inline" chunk, and that (absolute) number
of bytes of data immediately follow it.  If the number is non-negative then it
is an index into the object refs array for an "external" chunk.

Zero is a non-negative value, so it's an object reference.  It's not possible
to have a zero-byte inline chunk.  This also means that the high/sign bit
determines which case (inline vs. external) we have and there are an equal
number of both cases.

The stream is reassembled by iterating over the chunks and concatenating the
result.  For inline chunks, the inline data is taken directly from the
splitstream. For external chunks, the content of the external file is used.

The stream is over when there are no more chunks.

### Named references

It's possible to have named references to other streams.  These are stored in
the `named_refs` section referred to from the info section.

This section is also zstd-compressed, and is a number of nul-terminated text
records (including a terminator after the last record).  Each record has the
form `n:name` where `n` is a non-negative integer index into the stream refs
array and `name` is an arbitrary name.  The entries are currently sorted by
name (by the writer implementation) but the order is not important to the
reader.  Whether or not this list is "officially" sorted or not may be pinned
down at some future point if a need should arise.

An example of the decompressed content of the section might be something like
`"0:first\01:second\0"`.
