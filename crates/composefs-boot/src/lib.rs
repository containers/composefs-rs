//! Boot integration for composefs filesystem images.
//!
//! This crate provides functionality to transform composefs filesystem images for boot
//! scenarios by extracting boot resources, applying SELinux labels, and preparing
//! bootloader entries. It supports both Boot Loader Specification (Type 1) entries
//! and Unified Kernel Images (Type 2) for UEFI boot.
